For those who wish to verify that the class files downloaded when accessing
Hushmail are genuine, they can be compared against class files compiled from
source using the following tools.

Sun JDK on Ubuntu (sun-java6 6-16-0ubuntu1.9.04)
Proguard 4.1 (http://proguard.sourceforge.net)

Usage of these tools can be determined from the included Makefile and
proguard.conf.  Note that the signing steps in the Makefile cannot be
accomplished, and so the class files must be compared individually.  You cannot
compare the entire archive.

The Java applet archive used by Hushmail is located here:

https://www.hushmail.com/shared/HushEncryptionEngine.jar

Please ensure that you are comparing the same versions.  Sometimes the release
of source code may lag a few days behind the update of Hushmail.
